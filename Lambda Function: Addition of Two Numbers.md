# Lambda Function in Python: Addition of Two Numbers

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim:
To write a Python program that defines a **lambda function** which takes two arguments `a` and `b`, and returns their sum.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm:
1. Get two integer inputs from the user.
2. Use a **lambda function** to define a function `f` that returns `a + b`.
3. Call the function with the user inputs and print the result.

## ðŸ§¾ Program:
```
sum_lambda = lambda a, b: a + b
a = int(input())
b = int(input())
result = sum_lambda(a, b)
print(f"The sum of {a} and {b} is {result}")
```
## Output:
```
  Input             Result
  
   10           The sum of 10 and 5 is 15
   5
```
## Result:
The program of lambda function sum of two values was successful.
