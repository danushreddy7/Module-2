# Built-in Functions -Binary Conversion Using Built-in Functions in Python

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program to convert the number **16** into its **binary representation** using built-in Python functions.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Assign the value `16` to a variable `a`.
2. Use the built-in `bin()` function to convert the number to binary.
3. Print the result.

## ðŸ§¾ Program:
```
number = 16
binary_representation = bin(number)
print("Binary representation of", number, "is", binary_representation)
```
## Output:
```
   Input           Result

    16            Binary representation of 16 is 0b10000
```
## Result:
The program for binary conversion was successful.
